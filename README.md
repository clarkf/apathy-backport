# Apathy Backport Mod

A Minecraft mod backporting apathy mechanics to 1.7.10. When
installed, hostile mobs will be unable to target or harm players. This
allows players to engage in combat selectively, while still having
access to mob drops.

Flexibility and configuration is a non-goal for this mod. If you need
to fight a mob that will target you back (e.g. Ender Dragon, Twilight
Forest's Lich), disable the mod temporarily.

## Why?

Many players feel that Minecraft's combat mechanics are dull, or even
distract from the core gameplay loop. [To quote the author of the
original Apathetic Mobs][apathetic-annoucement]:

> I have a crippling fear of mobs. It's really annoying, and I can't
> shake it, and I know others do, too. But, for whatever reason you
> play in peaceful mode, there are all kinds of great expert modpacks
> today that base progression off of farming mob dropsâ€”and while
> that's not evil in and of itself, for me, it's untenable.

This mod brings the same benefits to 1.7.10 modpacks.
